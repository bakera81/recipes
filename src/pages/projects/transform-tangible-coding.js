        Using the TRANSFORM shape displays at the MIT Media Lab's <a href="https://tangible.media.mit.edu/">Tangible Media Group</a>, I worked with a small team to develop a physical programming language that used gestures and physical interaction to perform basic commands.

        Computer programming is a skill with a high initial learning curve, which can often discourage early learners. Our team developed a tactile, holistic programming environment that leveraged the benefits of tangibility to help learners develop a more resilient understanding of computer science concepts.
